**Change No.**: 4
**Requestor**: Joseph Koivisto
**Date of Request:** November 12th, 2025
**Priority**: Medium

### Description of Change
We want to clearly identify pages that are candidates for being archived. A simple way to do this would be to look a the last modified date. We want users to be able to tweak the threshold. Fine granularity is not needed; year will suffice. 

### Reason for Change


## Change Impacts

### Scope
The scope is expanding to include additional data - whether an item may be a good candidate for archiving or not. 

### Deliverables
We need to update our product documentation and code.

### Cost

N/A

### Resources

A small amount of development time.

### Timeline

Negligible amount of time for this task.

### Stakeholders

This will allow Stakeholders to make better decisions. 

## Risk Analysis

### Risk - Out of Date Docs

A risk of this process would be that the product documentation would lag behind, getting out of date. 

#### Risk Mitigation Strategies

Clearly identify all sections of the code and application documentation where this change will impact. 

### Risk - Confusion

Adding extra information can overwhelm or confuse the user. 

#### Risk Mitigation Strategies

We want to make this simple, and to be able to give the user a good visual indicator of when an article might be a candidate for archiving.
