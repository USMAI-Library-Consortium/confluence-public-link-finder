### Description of Change
I have found out that the Confluence API allows for query params that include type. Right now, we are pulling ALL articles and then filtering them. This is not efficient. 

### Reason for Change
In the future I want to add an additional filter - filtering out pages that are archived. This may be possible with an additional query param. So this is just setting the precident.
